# InkBird-Thermometer Home Assistant Template

Why:
The actual sensor will so "32" when probe is unplugged and when the Thermometer is powered off all probes will show "Unavailable".
I did not like the way this looked. 

Now with this template, if the probe is unplugged it will show "off" and if the Thermometer is powered off the probes will also show "off".


 The first sensor is to show if the Thermometer is on or off. Just change the entity ID to one of your probes.
 
 The next four are for each probe. Just update the entity ID's.
